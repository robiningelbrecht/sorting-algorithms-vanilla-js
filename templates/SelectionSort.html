            Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the
            sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and
            the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist
            is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest
            element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in
            sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
